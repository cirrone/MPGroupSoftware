This application will simulate, using the TOPAS Monte Carlo tool, a Thomson Parabola spectrometer for ions emitted in a laser-matter interaction process.
 
This folder will be updated in process. To date, this folder has a source folder, which contains two folders for proton and alpha-particle sources generated by laser-driven beam. 

Since particles generated by pB reaction depend on many factors, I would keep refering to the articles, to which the source or TPS design are corresponded. 
These sources are corresponded to the article https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h414zaLx3PUCq9Yi9pl7NzHPVVhUYJ9e/view?usp=sharing. 
Proton folder is dedicatd to reporduce a proton-beam from laser-driven acceleration (from surface contamination). It includes the beam, detector, physics, and scoring files, all these files names are written in fie "proton" including the graphics.
Alpha folder is dedicated to reproduce alpha-particle source generated by pB reaction. This folder has a source file with continuous spectrum, a detector file, physics and scoring files. The alpha file includes all other files.
